- `1`: will be implemented in the future

- `2`: only available for selected Android devices 



Keep in mind that **My Phone** was built only because Microsoft *Your Phone* does not support iOS, Windows Phone and other devices. If you are an Android user, you'd better use *Your Phone*.



## Implementation 

### Project structure

| Project                    | Type                             | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *MyPhone.TrayApp.XamlHost* | C++ UWP Project                  | XAML island host                                             |
| *MyPhone.TrayApp*          | C++ Win32 Project                | Main app logic, system tray UI and UWP "broker". Enable the UWP app to call Win32 APIs and keeping the app running in the background. Use XAML island to make the system tray UI has the same look and feel as native UWP system apps. This project handles main app logic including Bluetooth HFP stuff. |
| *MyPhone*                  | C# UWP Project                   | Main app UI                                                  |
| *PackageProject*           | Desktop Bridge Packaging Project | Generate MSIX app package                                    |

### Bluetooth HFP

This app use Windows Runtime APIs: `Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls` , `Windows.Devices.Bluetooth` and `Windows.Devices.Enumeration` to make the HFP works.

1. Use ``Windows.Devices.Enumeration` API to enumerate available `PhoneLineTransportDevice` (paired Bluetooth devices that support HFP),
2. Call `PhoneLineTransportDevice.RegisterApp` to register the device for HFP
3. Then the system will handle the rest (establishing HFP Service Level Connection and etc.) for you.

Note that *Your Phone* use the same APIs mentioned above.

### Self-implemented HFP stack?

Self-implementing a HFP stack is a little bit problematic because the only way to establish a SCO audio connection and transfer audio is to write a custom **user-mode** profile driver and let the end-user to install it. That's quite inconvenient for end-users to use this app.

Actually, I did try to implement HFP stack before. I managed to establish the HFP Service Level Connection (SLC) and successfully make the phone call via SLC, but failed to establish SCO audio connection and transfer any audio due to the reason above. If you're interested in how to establish HFP Service Level Connection, you may find the demo project `MyPhone.CLI` in `legacy` branch.
